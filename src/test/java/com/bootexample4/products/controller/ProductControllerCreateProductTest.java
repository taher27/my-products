"""
  Scenario 1: Test product creation with valid input data

  Details:
    TestName: testCreateProductWithValidInput
    Description: This test is meant to check the creation of a new product using valid input data. The target scenario is when the user provides all the required fields for the product correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A product object with all required fields correctly filled.
    Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the valid product object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned product matches the input product and the repository's save method was called with the correct product.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the product creation is successful with valid input data. The expected result is the same product object that was input, indicating successful creation. This test is significant as it ensures the basic functionality of the product creation process.

  Scenario 2: Test product creation with missing fields in the input data

  Details:
    TestName: testCreateProductWithMissingInput
    Description: This test is meant to check the creation of a new product using input data with missing required fields. The target scenario is when the user does not provide all the required fields for the product.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A product object with some required fields missing.
    Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the incomplete product object.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the product creation fails when required fields are missing. The expected result is an exception, indicating that the creation process correctly identifies missing fields. This test is significant as it ensures the robustness of the product creation process.

  Scenario 3: Test product creation with invalid input data

  Details:
    TestName: testCreateProductWithInvalidInput
    Description: This test is meant to check the creation of a new product using invalid input data. The target scenario is when the user provides fields for the product that do not meet the validation criteria.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A product object with some fields filled with invalid data.
    Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the invalid product object.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the product creation fails when the input data is invalid. The expected result is an exception, indicating that the creation process correctly identifies invalid data. This test is significant as it ensures the robustness of the product creation process against invalid data.

/*
Based on the error log provided, the test `testCreateProductWithMissingInput` is failing because it is expecting an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when creating a product with missing input, but no exception is thrown. 

This happens because the business logic method `createProduct` in the controller doesn't have any validation to check if the product object's fields are null or not before saving it in the repository. It directly saves the object in the repository without any checks. 

So, when you pass an empty product object to the `createProduct` method, it doesn't throw an `IllegalArgumentException` as expected by the test method. 

To fix this issue, you should add validation logic in the `createProduct` method to check the product object's fields and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if any field is null or empty. After adding this validation, the test should pass as expected.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testCreateProductWithMissingInput() {
    Product product = new Product();
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> productController.createProduct(product));
}

/*
The test `testCreateProductWithInvalidInput` is failing because it expects an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when creating a product with invalid input, but no such exception is being thrown. 

The test is designed to create a product with an empty name, empty description, and negative price. It then calls the `createProduct` method in the `ProductController` class and expects it to throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

However, the `createProduct` method in the `ProductController` class does not have any validation checks for these invalid inputs. It simply takes the `Product` object and saves it to the `ProductRepository`. Therefore, no `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown, leading to the test failure.

In order to fix the test, validation checks should be added to the `createProduct` method in the `ProductController` class to ensure that the product name is not empty, the description is not empty, and the price is not negative. If any of these conditions are not met, the method should throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testCreateProductWithInvalidInput() {
    Product product = new Product();
    product.setName("");
    product.setDescription("");
    product.setPrice(-100.0);
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> productController.createProduct(product));
