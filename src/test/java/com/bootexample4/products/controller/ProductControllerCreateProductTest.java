Scenario 1: Test product creation with valid data

Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithValidData
  Description: This test checks whether the product is created successfully when valid product data is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid data. Mock the productRepository.save() method to return the same Product object when called. 
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned Product object is the same as the one passed in the createProduct method.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the createProduct method returns the same Product object that is passed into it, indicating successful creation of the product. This is crucial for ensuring that the product creation functionality works as expected.

Scenario 2: Test product creation with null data

Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithNullData
  Description: This test checks how the createProduct method handles the scenario when null data is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass null as the argument to the createProduct method. 
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with null data. 
  Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that a NullPointerException is thrown when null data is provided. This is important to ensure that the method handles null data appropriately and prevents the creation of invalid products.

Scenario 3: Test product creation with invalid data

Details:  
  TestName: createProductWithInvalidData
  Description: This test checks how the createProduct method handles the scenario when invalid product data is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with invalid data, such as a negative price or a null name. Mock the productRepository.save() method to throw an IllegalArgumentException when called with invalid data. 
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object. 
  Assert: Assert that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown when invalid data is provided. This is important to ensure that the method validates product data and prevents the creation of invalid products.

Scenario 4: Test product creation when database operation fails

Details:  
  TestName: createProductWhenDatabaseOperationFails
  Description: This test checks how the createProduct method handles the scenario when the database operation fails. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Product object with valid data. Mock the productRepository.save() method to throw a RuntimeException when called. 
  Act: Call the createProduct method with the mock Product object. 
  Assert: Assert that a RuntimeException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that a RuntimeException is thrown when the database operation fails. This is important to ensure that the method handles database operation failures appropriately and informs the caller of the failure.
