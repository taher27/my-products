```
Scenario 1: Update existing product successfully

Details:
  TestName: updateExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks if the updateProduct method successfully updates an existing product and returns the updated product with correct HTTP status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the findById method of productRepository to return an existing product. Prepare a product object with updated fields.
  Act: Call updateProduct method with valid product ID and updated product object.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity contains the updated product and the HTTP status is OK (200).
Validation:
  Validate that the returned product matches the updated fields and HTTP status is OK. This confirms that the update operation was successful and the system behaves as expected when updating valid entries.

Scenario 2: Attempt to update a non-existent product

Details:
  TestName: updateNonExistentProduct
  Description: This test ensures that the updateProduct method returns a not found (404) status when trying to update a product that does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the findById method of productRepository to return an empty Optional for a non-existent product ID.
  Act: Call updateProduct method with a non-existent product ID and any product object.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity status is NOT_FOUND (404).
Validation:
  Validate that the response status is 404 NOT_FOUND, indicating that the product to be updated does not exist. This confirms the correctness of error handling for non-existent resources.

Scenario 3: Update product with null values in fields

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithNullValues
  Description: This test checks how the updateProduct method handles cases where the product fields (name, description, price) might be null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the findById method of productRepository to return an existing product. Prepare a product object with null values in one or more fields.
  Act: Call updateProduct method with a valid product ID and the product object with null fields.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity contains the product with updated (null) fields and the HTTP status is OK (200).
Validation:
  Validate that the updated product fields are set to null as per input, and the response status is OK. This test is significant to ensure the system's robustness in handling partial or null data during updates.

Scenario 4: Update product with extreme values for price

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithExtremePriceValues
  Description: This test evaluates the behavior of the updateProduct method when extremely high or low values are set for the product's price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the findById method of productRepository to return an existing product. Prepare a product object with extreme values for the price field.
  Act: Call updateProduct method with a valid product ID and the product object with extreme price values.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity contains the product with updated price and the HTTP status is OK (200).
Validation:
  Validate that the updated product reflects the extreme price value and the response status is OK. This test checks the system's ability to handle extreme data values without failure.

The test failure is caused by a `NullPointerException` due to the `productRepository` being `null` at the time it is invoked within the test method `updateExistingProduct`. This error usually occurs in a unit test when the dependencies of the class under test are not properly initialized or mocked.

In this specific case, the `ProductController` class that contains the `updateProduct` method relies on `productRepository` to function correctly. However, during the test execution, `productRepository` has not been instantiated or mocked, leading to a `NullPointerException` when `productRepository.findById(Object)` is called.

To resolve this issue, the test setup should include the initialization of `productRepository` by mocking it, ensuring that when `productRepository.findById(anyLong())` and `productRepository.save(any(Product.class))` are called within the test, they are operating on a non-null object. This is typically done using a mocking framework like Mockito and annotations such as `@Mock` for creating mock objects and `@InjectMocks` for injecting these mocks into the class under test.

In summary, the test fails because the necessary mock setup for `productRepository` is missing or incomplete, leading to a `NullPointerException` when methods on this mock object are invoked. Properly setting up the mock and ensuring it is injected into the `ProductController` will resolve the test failure.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void updateExistingProduct() {
    when(productRepository.findById(anyLong())).thenReturn(Optional.of(existingProduct));
    when(productRepository.save(any(Product.class))).thenReturn(updatedProduct);
    ResponseEntity<Product> response = productController.updateProduct(1L, updatedProduct);
    assertEquals(OK, response.getStatusCode());
    assertNotNull(response.getBody());
    assertEquals("Updated Name", response.getBody().getName());
    assertEquals("Updated Description", response.getBody().getDescription());
    assertEquals(150.0, response.getBody().getPrice());

The test failure in the `updateNonExistentProduct` test method is caused by a `NullPointerException`. This exception arises because the `productRepository` used in the `updateProduct` method of the `ProductController` class is null at the time of the test execution.

The root cause of this `NullPointerException` is due to the fact that the `productRepository` is not properly initialized or mocked in the test environment before the test method is executed. In the unit test, it appears that `productRepository` needs to be injected into the `ProductController` or mocked using a framework such as Mockito, but this setup step has been either overlooked or improperly configured. 

Typically, in a Spring Boot environment, repositories are injected into controllers via Spring's Dependency Injection features. However, in a testing scenario, particularly unit tests, you need to manually ensure that these dependencies are provided. This can be achieved either by setting up a test configuration that includes mock beans, or by explicitly initializing the controller with mock dependencies in the test setup phase.

To resolve this test failure, you should ensure that `productRepository` is mocked and that this mock is injected into the `ProductController` instance being tested. This setup would typically be done in a setup method (`@BeforeEach`) in the test class, or directly within the test method before the controller's method is called.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void updateNonExistentProduct() {
    when(productRepository.findById(anyLong())).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
    ResponseEntity<Product> response = productController.updateProduct(1L, updatedProduct);
    assertEquals(NOT_FOUND, response.getStatusCode());
}

The test method `updateProductWithNullValues` is failing due to a `NullPointerException` that arises because the `productRepository` instance is `null` at the time of its method invocation. This typically occurs in a unit testing scenario where the repository dependency within the class under test is not properly mocked or injected before the test runs.

In this specific case, the `productRepository` is being used within the `updateProduct` method of the `ProductController` class to find and save product details. However, during the test execution, this repository is not instantiated or mocked correctly, leading to `null` being dereferenced when `findById` is called on it.

To resolve this issue, the test setup should include proper initialization of mocks for all dependencies, specifically `productRepository`. This can typically be achieved using a mocking framework (like Mockito) to create mock instances of the dependencies and then injecting these mocks into the class being tested, either through constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection using annotations like `@InjectMocks` if using Mockito. This setup step appears to be missing or incorrectly implemented in the provided test scenario, leading to the observed `NullPointerException`.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void updateProductWithNullValues() {
    Product nullFieldsProduct = new Product();
    nullFieldsProduct.setName(null);
    nullFieldsProduct.setDescription(null);
    nullFieldsProduct.setPrice(0.0);
    when(productRepository.findById(anyLong())).thenReturn(Optional.of(existingProduct));
    when(productRepository.save(any(Product.class))).thenReturn(nullFieldsProduct);
    ResponseEntity<Product> response = productController.updateProduct(1L, nullFieldsProduct);
    assertEquals(OK, response.getStatusCode());

/*
The test failure is caused by a `NullPointerException` due to the `productRepository` being `null` within the test environment. This issue typically occurs because the test does not properly set up or mock the `productRepository` dependency that is used in the `ProductController`.

In the test method `updateProductWithExtremePriceValues`, the `productRepository` is used to handle database operations like `findById` and `save`. However, the test logs indicate that when `productRepository.findById(anyLong())` is called, it leads to a `NullPointerException` because `productRepository` has not been instantiated or mocked correctly.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the `productRepository` is correctly mocked in the test setup phase using a mocking framework like Mockito. This involves initializing the mock and setting up the necessary behavior (e.g., returning an `Optional` of `existingProduct` when `findById` is called) before the test method is executed. This setup is crucial for isolating the test environment from external dependencies and focusing on the functionality being tested.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void updateProductWithExtremePriceValues() {
    Product extremePriceProduct = new Product();
    extremePriceProduct.setName("Extreme Price Product");
    extremePriceProduct.setDescription("Extreme Price Description");
    extremePriceProduct.setPrice(Double.MAX_VALUE);
