ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Test to delete a product that exists in the repository

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: The test is designed to check if a product that exists in the repository can be successfully deleted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an existing product when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the existing product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is OK.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product was successfully deleted from the repository. This is expected since the product exists in the repository. The test ensures the delete functionality is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to delete a product that does not exist in the repository

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: The test is designed to check if the function can handle attempts to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with an id that does not correspond to any product in the repository.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product was not found in the repository and therefore could not be deleted. This is expected since the product does not exist in the repository. The test ensures the function can handle attempts to delete non-existing products gracefully.

Scenario 3: Test to delete a product when the repository is empty

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductFromEmptyRepository
  Description: The test is designed to check if the function can handle attempts to delete a product from an empty repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called, regardless of the id provided.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with any id.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product was not found in the repository and therefore could not be deleted. This is expected since the repository is empty. The test ensures the function can handle attempts to delete products from an empty repository gracefully.
