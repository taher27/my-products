Scenario 1: Test to delete a product that exists in the repository

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: The test is designed to check if a product that exists in the repository can be successfully deleted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an existing product when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the existing product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is OK.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product was successfully deleted from the repository. This is expected since the product exists in the repository. The test ensures the delete functionality is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to delete a product that does not exist in the repository

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: The test is designed to check if the function can handle attempts to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with an id that does not correspond to any product in the repository.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product was not found in the repository and therefore could not be deleted. This is expected since the product does not exist in the repository. The test ensures the function can handle attempts to delete non-existing products gracefully.

Scenario 3: Test to delete a product when the repository is empty

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductFromEmptyRepository
  Description: The test is designed to check if the function can handle attempts to delete a product from an empty repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called, regardless of the id provided.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with any id.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product was not found in the repository and therefore could not be deleted. This is expected since the repository is empty. The test ensures the function can handle attempts to delete products from an empty repository gracefully.

/*
The test case `deleteExistingProduct()` is failing due to a `NullPointerException`. The error message states `Cannot invoke "com.bootexample4.products.repository.ProductRepository.findById(Object)" because "this.productRepository" is null`.

This error occurs because the `productRepository` object is not initialized before it is used in the test method. In the test setup, you are trying to stub the `findById()` method of `productRepository`, but the `productRepository` itself is null at this point. 

This typically happens when the mock object is not properly injected/initialized in the test class. In this case, it seems like the `productRepository` is not being mocked properly. 

You need to ensure that the `productRepository` is properly mocked using an annotation like `@Mock` (if you are using Mockito for testing) and it is being injected into the class under test properly before you try to stub its methods. 

Remember to initialize your mocks (for example, by calling `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);` in your test setup method if you're using Mockito) before you use them. This will create the mock instance of `ProductRepository` and avoid the `NullPointerException`.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void deleteExistingProduct() {
    Product product = new Product();
    when(productRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(product));
    ResponseEntity<Object> response = productController.deleteProduct(1L);
    assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatusCode());
}

/*
The test `deleteNonExistingProduct` is failing due to a `NullPointerException`. The error message indicates that "this.productRepository" is null. This suggests that the `productRepository` instance, which is needed to run the test, has not been initialized before the test runs. 

This could be because the `productRepository` instance is not being injected into the test class, or it is not being mocked correctly. In the test, there is a mocking statement `when(productRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());` but if the `productRepository` itself is null, this line will throw a `NullPointerException`.

In simple terms, the test is failing because the `productRepository` used in the test has not been properly initialized or set up before the test runs. The `productRepository` needs to be a mock instance for the test to run correctly.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void deleteNonExistingProduct() {
    when(productRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
    ResponseEntity<Object> response = productController.deleteProduct(1L);
    assertEquals(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, response.getStatusCode());
}

/*
The test `deleteProductFromEmptyRepository` is failing due to a `NullPointerException` at the line where `productRepository.findById(1L)` is called. The error message indicates that `this.productRepository` is null. 

This means that the `productRepository` instance is not initialized before the test is run. In the context of a unit test, this repository is usually mocked using a framework like Mockito. The error suggests that this mock setup step might be missing or not correctly implemented in the test setup method.

Therefore, the failure is not due to a problem in the business logic of the `deleteProduct` method or the test case itself, but rather due to the setup of the test environment. The `productRepository` needs to be properly initialized (or mocked) before running the test.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void deleteProductFromEmptyRepository() {
    when(productRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
    ResponseEntity<Object> response = productController.deleteProduct(1L);
    assertEquals(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, response.getStatusCode());
