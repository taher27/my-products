```
Scenario 1: Successfully delete an existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: Tests the successful deletion of a product that exists in the database. It should return an OK status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a non-empty Optional when findById is called with a specific ID.
  Act: Call deleteProduct method with the ID of the product that exists.
  Assert: Verify that the response is OK and the product is deleted from the repository.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the method returns an OK response, confirming that the product was successfully deleted. This is crucial for ensuring the integrity of delete operations in the application.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a non-existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: Tests the deletion attempt of a product that does not exist in the database. It should return a NOT_FOUND status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a specific ID.
  Act: Call deleteProduct method with the ID of a non-existent product.
  Assert: Verify that the response is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method handles cases where the product does not exist by returning a NOT_FOUND response. This test ensures that the application can gracefully handle deletion requests for non-existent entities.

Scenario 3: Delete product with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: Tests the behavior of the deleteProduct method when called with a null ID. It should handle the case without throwing unexpected exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed specifically for this test as the method should handle null internally.
  Act: Call deleteProduct method with null as the ID.
  Assert: Verify that the method handles the null input gracefully, potentially returning a BAD_REQUEST or similar response.
Validation:
  The assertion checks how the method handles null input. Ensuring robustness in handling null and invalid inputs is essential for the stability of the application.

Scenario 4: Database operation failure during product deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductDatabaseError
  Description: Tests the deleteProduct method behavior when there is a database operation failure during the deletion process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a DataAccessException (or similar) when delete is called.
  Act: Call deleteProduct method with an ID that triggers this exception.
  Assert: Verify that the method handles the exception properly, perhaps returning a SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE or INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method can handle exceptions during database operations. It is crucial for maintaining service reliability and informing users appropriately about issues.

Scenario 5: Verify repository deletion call

Details:
  TestName: verifyRepositoryDeletionCall
  Description: Ensure that the productRepository.delete method is called when an existing product is successfully found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a non-empty Optional for an existing product and track calls to delete.
  Act: Call deleteProduct method with the ID of an existing product.
  Assert: Verify that delete was called on the repository.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the delete method on the repository is indeed called, which is vital for ensuring that the deletion process is executed as expected in the application's workflow.

/*
The failure of the `deleteProductWithNullId` test function is primarily due to the method `productRepository.findById(null)` being invoked despite the test expectation that this method should never be called with a `null` argument. The test is designed to verify that when `null` is passed as an ID to the `deleteProduct` method, the `findById` method on `productRepository` should not be executed. However, the test logs indicate that `findById(null)` was indeed called, leading to the test failure.

The expectation set by `verify(productRepository, never()).findById(null);` in the test method specifies that `findById` should never be called with `null` as the argument. The failure occurs because the actual business logic in the `deleteProduct` method does not include any checks to prevent the invocation of `findById` when the ID is `null`. As a result, `findById(null)` is executed, which contradicts the test's expectations.

To resolve this issue, the business logic in `deleteProduct` should be adjusted to include a null check before calling `findById`. Alternatively, the test could be updated to reflect the current behavior of the business logic, acknowledging that `findById` may be called with `null` under certain conditions. However, from a best practices standpoint, it's generally advisable to handle `null` inputs gracefully in the business logic to prevent potential `NullPointerExceptions` or similar issues in a live environment.
