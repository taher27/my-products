 Scenario 1: Delete an existing product with a valid ID

TestName: deleteExistingProduct()

Details:
This test aims to check if the deleteProduct() method correctly deletes a product from the repository when provided with a valid ID of an existing product.

Execution:
Arrange:

* Set up a test product in the repository with a valid ID.

Act:

* Invoke the deleteProduct() method with the valid ID of the test product.

Assert:

* Verify that the productRepository.findById(id) returns a present value.
* Verify that the productRepository.delete(product) method is called.
* Verify that the ResponseEntity.ok().build() is returned.

Validation:
The assertion verifies that the deleteProduct() method can successfully delete a product from the repository when provided with a valid ID. This test scenario is significant because it checks the core functionality of the deleteProduct() method.



Scenario 2: Delete a non-existing product with an invalid ID

TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct()

Details:
This test aims to check if the deleteProduct() method returns ResponseEntity.notFound().build() when provided with an invalid ID of a non-existing product.

Execution:
Arrange:

* Set up a non-existing product with an invalid ID in the repository.

Act:

* Invoke the deleteProduct() method with the invalid ID of the non-existing product.

Assert:

* Verify that the productRepository.findById(id) returns an absent value.
* Verify that the productRepository.delete(product) method is not called.
* Verify that the ResponseEntity.notFound().build() is returned.

Validation:
The assertion verifies that the deleteProduct() method returns the correct error message when provided with an invalid ID of a non-existing product. This test scenario is significant because it checks the error handling of the deleteProduct() method.



Scenario 3: Delete a product with a null ID

TestName: deleteProductWithNullId()

Details:
This test aims to check if the deleteProduct() method returns ResponseEntity.notFound().build() when provided with a null ID.

Execution:
Arrange:

* Set up a test product in the repository with a valid ID.

Act:

* Invoke the deleteProduct() method with a null ID.

Assert:

* Verify that the productRepository.findById(id) returns an absent value.
* Verify that the productRepository.delete(product) method is not called.
* Verify that the ResponseEntity.notFound().build() is returned.

Validation:
The assertion verifies that the deleteProduct() method returns the correct error message when provided with a null ID. This test scenario is significant because it checks the input validation of the deleteProduct() method.



Scenario 4: Delete a product with a negative ID

TestName: deleteProductWithNegativeId()

Details:
This test aims to check if the deleteProduct() method returns ResponseEntity.notFound().build() when provided with a negative ID.

Execution:
Arrange:

* Set up a test product in the repository with a valid ID.

Act:

* Invoke the deleteProduct() method with a negative ID.

Assert:

* Verify that the productRepository.findById(id) returns an absent value.
* Verify that the productRepository.delete(product) method is not called.
* Verify that the ResponseEntity.notFound().build() is returned.

Validation:
The assertion verifies that the deleteProduct() method returns the correct error message when provided with a negative ID. This test scenario is significant because it checks the input validation of the deleteProduct() method.

/*
 The unit test is failing because the `deleteProduct` method in the `productController` is being called with an argument of `null`, which is not a valid input for the method. The method is expecting a non-null `Long` value as a path variable.

In the `deleteProduct` method, the `findById` method of the `productRepository` is called with the given id, if the id is present in the database then the object is deleted, otherwise, it returns a `ResponseEntity.notFound().build()`.

In the test case `deleteProductWithNullId`, it is expected that the `findById` and `delete` method of the `productRepository` should never be called when a `null` value is passed as an argument. But in the actual method, it is trying to call the `findById` method which is causing the test to fail.

The error message "`ler.deleteProduct(ProductController.java:49) with arguments: [null]`" is indicating that the `deleteProduct` method in the `ProductController` class is being called with a `null` argument at line 49.

To fix this issue, the test case should be modified to pass a valid non-null `Long` value as an argument or the production code should be modified to handle the `null` value in a way that it doesn't try to call the `findById` method.

Additionally, the test is expecting that the response should be equal to `ResponseEntity.notFound().build()` but it's not checking if the `findById` and `delete` method of the `productRepository` are called or not.

It is important to note that, if the `productRepository` is an external dependency, the test environment should be properly set up to include a mock of this dependency so the test can run successfully.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void deleteProductWithNullId() {
    // Act
    ResponseEntity<Object> response = productController.deleteProduct(null);
    // Assert
    verify(productRepository, never()).findById(any());
    verify(productRepository, never()).delete(any());
    Assertions.assertEquals(ResponseEntity.notFound().build(), response);

 The `deleteProductWithNegativeId` test is failing because it is expecting the `findById` and `delete` methods of the `productRepository` to never be called when a negative ID is passed to the `deleteProduct` method. However, based on the error log provided, it seems that the `deleteProduct` method is still being called with an ID of -1, which causes the `findById` and `delete` methods to be called. This is in contradiction to the expectations set in the test method, hence the test is failing.

The reason for the `deleteProduct` method still being called with a negative ID is not clear from the information provided. It could be due to an issue in the business logic, or it could be due to an external dependency that is not properly set up. Nonetheless, the current implementation of the `deleteProduct` method does not handle the case of negative IDs correctly, and this is causing the test to fail.

To fix this issue, the `deleteProduct` method should be modified to handle the case of negative IDs correctly, for example by throwing an exception or returning an error response. Additionally, the test method should be updated to reflect the expected behavior in this case.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void deleteProductWithNegativeId() {
    // Arrange
    Long id = -1L;
    // Act
    ResponseEntity<Object> response = productController.deleteProduct(id);
    // Assert
    verify(productRepository, never()).findById(any());
    verify(productRepository, never()).delete(any());
    Assertions.assertEquals(ResponseEntity.notFound().build(), response);
