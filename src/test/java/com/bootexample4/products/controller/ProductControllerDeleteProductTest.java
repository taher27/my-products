Scenario 1: Successful Deletion of Existing Product

Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulDeletionOfExistingProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check if the deleteProduct method is able to successfully delete a product that exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a Product object when findById is called with a specific id that exists in the repository.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the specific id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned ResponseEntity has a status of 200 OK.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product has been successfully deleted from the repository. The expected result is a status of 200 OK, which signifies a successful deletion. This test validates the normal operation of the deleteProduct method.

Scenario 2: Attempt to Delete a Non-existing Product

Details:
  TestName: testDeletionOfNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check how the deleteProduct method handles the scenario when an attempt is made to delete a product that doesn't exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a specific id that does not exist in the repository.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the specific non-existing id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned ResponseEntity has a status of 404 NOT FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product does not exist in the repository and therefore cannot be deleted. The expected result is a status of 404 NOT FOUND, which signifies that the requested resource is not available. This test validates the error handling of the deleteProduct method when faced with non-existing products.

Scenario 3: Attempt to Delete a Product with Null ID

Details:
  TestName: testDeletionOfProductWithNullId
  Description: This test is meant to check how the deleteProduct method handles the scenario when an attempt is made to delete a product with a null id.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to mock the productRepository as the method should handle a null id.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an appropriate exception (like IllegalArgumentException) is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method is able to handle null input and throws an appropriate exception. This test validates the error handling of the deleteProduct method when faced with null input.
