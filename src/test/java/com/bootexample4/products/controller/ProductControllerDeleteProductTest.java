Scenario 1: Delete Product with Valid ID

Details:  
  TestName: deleteProductWithValidID.
  Description: The test is meant to check the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID. It verifies that the product with the given ID is successfully deleted from the repository.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository and its findById method to return a Product object when given a valid ID. Also, mock the delete method to remove the product from the repository.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the valid ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of 200 (OK).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the product with the valid ID is successfully deleted. The significance of this test lies in ensuring that the deleteProduct method works as expected when given a valid product ID.

Scenario 2: Delete Product with Invalid ID

Details:  
  TestName: deleteProductWithInvalidID.
  Description: The test is meant to check the deleteProduct method with an invalid product ID. It verifies that the method handles invalid IDs correctly and returns a 404 (Not Found) status.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository and its findById method to return an empty Optional when given an invalid ID.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the invalid ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of 404 (Not Found).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles invalid product IDs by returning a 404 status. This test is significant as it checks the method's error handling capabilities.

Scenario 3: Delete Product with Null ID

Details:  
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullID.
  Description: The test is meant to check the deleteProduct method with a null ID. It verifies that the method handles null IDs correctly and returns a 404 (Not Found) status.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the ID is null.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of 404 (Not Found).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles null product IDs by returning a 404 status. This test is significant as it checks the method's error handling capabilities when dealing with null IDs.
