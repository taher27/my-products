================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The deleteProduct method in the ProductController class seems to allow deleting a product solely based on the product ID, leaving it vulnerable to an unauthorized deletion if an attacker guesses or brute-force attacks the IDs.
Solution: Implement user role checks and authorization prior to carrying out sensitive operations like deleting a product. Also, ensure ID values are not predictable, possibly by using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) for product identification.

Vulnerability: Unrestricted Data Deletion or CWE-400
Issue: If the REST API allows mass deletion by accepting an array of IDs, there is the risk of an attacker causing a Denial of Service (DoS) by flooding the deletion endpoint.
Solution: Place a reasonable limit on the number of items that can be deleted at once and implement rate limiting on the API endpoints.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the product is deleted successfully

  Details:
    TestName: testProductDeletedSuccessfully
    Description: This test is meant to check if a valid product provided by the ID gets deleted successfully.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock Product with an ID that exists in the database. Mock the ProductRepository findById and delete method.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the existing product ID.
    Assert: Verify that the productRepository delete method was called and Response Entity received is OK.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the product with valid ID is correctly deleted from the database and the method returns correct Response Entity. This test is significant in verifying the correct functionality of the deletion operation in the application.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if an appropriate response is returned when a non-existing product ID is provided

  Details:
    TestName: testProductNotFoundWithInvalidId
    Description: This test is meant to check if a not found response is returned when an invalid product ID is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock Product with an ID that does not exist in the database. Mock the ProductRepository findById method.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the invalid product ID.
    Assert: Verify that the productRepository delete method was not called and the Response Entity received is Not Found.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that a not found response is correctly received in the scenario when a non-existing product ID is provided. This test is significant in verifying the correct behavior of the method in an error scenario.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify that any exception thrown is properly handled

  Details:
    TestName: testExceptionHandling
    Description: This test is meant to check that any exception thrown during the delete operation is properly caught and appropriately handled.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository and make it throw an exception when delete is called.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a valid product ID.
    Assert: Ensure that a proper error response is returned.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that any exceptions thrown during the deletion operation are correctly caught and handled without breaking the application. It ensures the robustness of the application in face of unexpected errors or exceptions.
