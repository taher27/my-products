================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The code does not perform any validation or sanitization on the 'id' input before using it to delete a product. This opens the door to potential security threats such as SQL Injection, where an attacker could manipulate the 'id' to execute arbitrary SQL statements.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure the 'id' is in the expected format and within the expected range before using it in the query. This can be achieved by using regular expressions, type checking, or built-in validation functions.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling (CWE-209)
Issue: The code does not handle errors properly. If the product is not found, it simply returns a 'not found' response without any further information. This could lead to a lack of traceability when an error occurs, making it difficult to debug and fix issues.
Solution: Implement proper error handling. This includes logging errors for debugging purposes and returning meaningful error messages to the user. However, be careful not to expose sensitive information in the error messages.

Vulnerability: Missing Authorization Check (CWE-285)
Issue: The code does not check if the user is authorized to delete the product. This could allow any user, including unauthorized ones, to delete products.
Solution: Implement an authorization check before deleting the product. Only allow users with the necessary permissions to delete products. This can be achieved by using role-based access control (RBAC) or similar authorization mechanisms.

"""
Scenario 1: Delete Existing Product Test
Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of deleting a product that exists in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a product and save it in the productRepository.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the saved product.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the product is no longer in the productRepository.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the product was successfully deleted from the productRepository. If the product was successfully deleted, it should no longer be found in the productRepository.

Scenario 2: Delete Non-Existing Product Test
Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when attempting to delete a product that does not exist in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to arrange any data as we are checking for a non-existing product.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a random id that does not exist in the productRepository.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the ResponseEntity status is 404 not found.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the situation when the product does not exist in the database. In this case, the appropriate response is to return a 404 not found status.

Scenario 3: Delete Product with Null Id Test
Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when attempting to delete a product with a null id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to arrange any data as we are checking for a product with a null id.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the situation when the id is null. In this case, the appropriate response is to throw an exception. This is important in maintaining the integrity of the data in the database.
