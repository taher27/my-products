"""
Scenario 1: Successful Deletion of a Product

Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulDeletion
  Description: This test case is intended to verify if the deleteProduct method can successfully delete a product in the repository given the product's id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a Product object when findById is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product id.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has a status of ok.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product was successfully deleted from the repository. The expected result is a response entity with an ok status, which indicates that the operation was successful.

Scenario 2: Product Not Found

Details:
  TestName: testProductNotFound
  Description: This test case is meant to validate the deleteProduct method's behavior when the product id provided does not exist in the product repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an id that does not exist in the product repository.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has a status of notFound.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the deleteProduct method correctly handles the scenario where a product with the specified id does not exist. The expected result is a response entity with a notFound status, indicating that the product was not found in the repository.

Scenario 3: Repository Error during Deletion

Details:
  TestName: testRepositoryError
  Description: This test case is meant to check the deleteProduct method's behavior when the productRepository throws an exception during the delete operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw an exception when delete is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a valid product id.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the deleteProduct method correctly handles the scenario where an exception is thrown by the productRepository. The expected result is an exception, indicating that there was an error in the repository operation.
