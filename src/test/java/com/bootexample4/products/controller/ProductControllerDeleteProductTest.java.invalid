ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

```
Scenario 1: Delete an existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that when a valid product ID is provided, the product is successfully deleted from the repository, and a successful response is returned.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test product in the repository.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is OK (200), and the product is no longer present in the repository.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteProduct method correctly removes an existing product from the repository and returns a successful response. This test covers the primary functionality of the deleteProduct method and ensures that the application behaves as expected when deleting a valid product.

Scenario 2: Delete a non-existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks the behavior when an attempt is made to delete a product with an ID that does not exist in the repository.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a non-existing product ID.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the non-existing product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is NOT_FOUND (404), indicating that the product was not found in the repository.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteProduct method correctly handles the case when a non-existing product ID is provided. It ensures that the application does not attempt to delete a non-existent product and returns an appropriate NOT_FOUND response. This test covers an edge case scenario and helps to validate the error handling of the deleteProduct method.

Scenario 3: Delete a product with an invalid ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithInvalidId
  Description: This test checks the behavior when an attempt is made to delete a product with an invalid ID, such as a negative value or a non-numeric value.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an invalid product ID, such as a negative value or a non-numeric value.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the invalid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception or error is thrown or handled gracefully.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteProduct method correctly handles invalid input, such as a negative or non-numeric product ID. It ensures that the application does not attempt to process an invalid ID and handles the error appropriately, either by throwing an exception or by returning an appropriate error response. This test covers an edge case scenario and helps to validate the input validation and error handling of the deleteProduct method.

Scenario 4: Delete a product and verify repository state

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductAndVerifyRepositoryState
  Description: This test verifies that when a product is deleted, the repository state is updated correctly, and the deleted product is no longer present in the repository.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test product in the repository and retrieve the initial repository size.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is OK (200), and the repository size has decreased by 1.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteProduct method not only returns a successful response but also updates the repository state correctly by removing the deleted product. This test covers the data integrity aspect of the deleteProduct method, ensuring that the repository remains in a consistent state after a successful deletion operation. It helps validate the overall functionality and data management of the deleteProduct method.
```

These test scenarios cover various cases, including successful deletion, deletion of a non-existing product, handling of invalid input, and verification of the repository state after deletion. They aim to thoroughly test the deleteProduct method and ensure that it behaves correctly under different conditions, including edge cases and error handling.
