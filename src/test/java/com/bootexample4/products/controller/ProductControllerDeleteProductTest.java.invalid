```
Scenario 1: Delete an existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that when a valid product ID is provided, the delete operation is successful, and the appropriate response is returned.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a new Product object, e.g., Product product = new Product(...);
    - Save the product to the repository using productRepository.save(product);
    - Store the ID of the saved product.

  Act:
    - Call the deleteProduct method with the saved product's ID.
    - Store the ResponseEntity<Object> returned by the method.

  Assert:
    - Assert that the returned ResponseEntity is not null.
    - Assert that the HTTP status code of the ResponseEntity is OK (200).

Validation:
  The test verifies that when a valid product ID is provided, the product is successfully deleted from the repository, and the method returns an HTTP 200 OK response. This is the expected behavior when a product deletion operation is successful.

Scenario 2: Delete a non-existing product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies the behavior when attempting to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Generate a random or non-existent product ID.

  Act:
    - Call the deleteProduct method with the non-existent product ID.
    - Store the ResponseEntity<Object> returned by the method.

  Assert:
    - Assert that the returned ResponseEntity is not null.
    - Assert that the HTTP status code of the ResponseEntity is NOT_FOUND (404).

Validation:
  The test verifies that when a non-existent product ID is provided, the delete operation fails gracefully, and the method returns an HTTP 404 NOT_FOUND response. This is the expected behavior when attempting to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.

Scenario 3: Delete a product with null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test verifies the behavior when attempting to delete a product with a null ID.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set the product ID to null.

  Act:
    - Call the deleteProduct method with the null product ID.
    - Store the ResponseEntity<Object> returned by the method.

  Assert:
    - Assert that the returned ResponseEntity is not null.
    - Assert that the HTTP status code of the ResponseEntity is BAD_REQUEST (400) or an appropriate error status code.

Validation:
  The test verifies that when a null product ID is provided, the delete operation fails with an appropriate error status code (e.g., BAD_REQUEST 400). This is the expected behavior when attempting to delete a product with an invalid or null ID.

Scenario 4: Delete a product with negative ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNegativeId
  Description: This test verifies the behavior when attempting to delete a product with a negative ID.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set the product ID to a negative value.

  Act:
    - Call the deleteProduct method with the negative product ID.
    - Store the ResponseEntity<Object> returned by the method.

  Assert:
    - Assert that the returned ResponseEntity is not null.
    - Assert that the HTTP status code of the ResponseEntity is BAD_REQUEST (400) or an appropriate error status code.

Validation:
  The test verifies that when a negative product ID is provided, the delete operation fails with an appropriate error status code (e.g., BAD_REQUEST 400). This is the expected behavior when attempting to delete a product with an invalid or negative ID.
```

Note: The provided test scenarios cover various cases, including successful deletion, deletion of a non-existing product, and invalid input scenarios (null ID and negative ID). These scenarios aim to ensure the correct behavior of the `deleteProduct` method under different conditions and edge cases.
