Scenario 1: Valid Product ID Provided

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithValidId
  Description: This scenario tests the method with a valid product ID to ensure it retrieves the correct product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a specific Product when findById is called with a valid ID.
  Act: Call getProductById with this valid ID.
  Assert: Validate that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of OK (200) and the body contains the correct Product data.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly fetches and returns the product when a valid ID is provided. This is crucial for ensuring that users can retrieve product details accurately.

Scenario 2: Invalid Product ID Provided

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithInvalidId
  Description: This test checks the response when an invalid or non-existing product ID is used to call the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an invalid ID.
  Act: Call getProductById using an invalid ID.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity returned has a status of NOT_FOUND (404).
Validation:
  This assertion confirms that the method appropriately handles cases where the product ID does not exist in the database, providing clear feedback that the product could not be found.

Scenario 3: Null Product ID Provided

Details:
  TestName: getProductByIdWithNullId
  Description: This scenario tests how the method handles a null ID input, expecting a certain type of exception or error handling to occur.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement since the input is null.
  Act: Call getProductById with a null ID.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown, such as IllegalArgumentException.
Validation:
  This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the method against null inputs, ensuring that the application can gracefully handle such cases without crashing.

/*
The test failure for `getProductByIdWithValidId` is caused by a `NoClassDefFoundError` related to the Mockito class initialization. This particular error suggests that there is a problem with the Mockito library setup or environment configuration, which prevents the Mockito classes from being found or correctly loaded during the test execution.

This issue often stems from one of the following problems:

1. **Incorrect or Missing Dependency**: The Mockito library might not be correctly added to the project's dependencies, or there might be a mismatch in the version that is incompatible with other used libraries or the JDK version.
   
2. **Classpath Issues**: There could be a problem with how the classes are being loaded or with the classpath configuration. This could be due to misconfiguration in the project's build setup (like Maven or Gradle).

3. **Static Initializer Failure**: The root cause `java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError` indicates that a static initialization block or the initializer for a static variable threw an exception. This could happen if there's a configuration issue within the Mockito setup or conflicts between different versions of libraries that include static code.

To resolve this issue, you should:
- Ensure that the Mockito library is correctly declared with the right version in your project's build file (pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle).
- Check for any conflicting libraries that might be causing class loading issues and resolve any version conflicts.
- Verify that the JDK version used is compatible with the version of Mockito and other libraries.
- Review any static initialization in your test classes or related utilities that might be indirectly causing this error during the Mockito initialization phase.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void getProductByIdWithValidId() {
    // TODO: Set necessary product fields
    Product mockProduct = new Product();
    mockProduct.setName("Test Product");
    when(productRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(mockProduct));
    ResponseEntity<Product> response = productController.getProductById(1L);
    assertEquals(200, response.getStatusCodeValue());
    assertEquals("Test Product", response.getBody().getName());
}

The test failure for the `getProductByIdWithInvalidId` method is primarily due to an issue with the Mockito framework initialization, as indicated by the error log: `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.mockito.Mockito`. This error suggests that there is a problem with the setup or configuration of Mockito, possibly due to a missing or corrupted Mockito library or a conflict between different versions of libraries that include Mockito.

The root cause of the error seems to be an `ExceptionInInitializerError`, which is thrown when there is an unexpected exception during the initialization of a class. In this case, it's related to Mockito's initialization process. The stack trace suggests that the error occurred during the loading of the Mockito plugin, which failed to initialize properly.

Possible reasons for this issue could include:

1. **Classpath Issues**: The Mockito library or one of its dependencies might not be correctly included in the project's classpath. This can happen if the library is not properly defined in the project's dependency management tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle).

2. **Corrupted JARs**: The JAR files for Mockito or its dependencies might be corrupted. Re-downloading these dependencies could resolve the issue.

3. **Version Conflicts**: There may be conflicting versions of Mockito or related libraries being used. Ensuring that all dependencies are compatible and using the same version of Mockito across the project can help.

4. **Environment Factors**: If the project is running in a special environment (like a CI server), environmental factors such as JVM arguments or security settings might be interfering with Mockito's operation.

To resolve this issue, the following steps are recommended:

- Verify that Mockito and all its dependencies are correctly declared and available in the project's build configuration (like the `pom.xml` file for Maven projects).
- Clean the project's workspace and rebuild the project to ensure all dependencies are fetched and compiled correctly.
- Check for any version conflicts or exclusions in the dependency tree that might cause incompatible versions to be loaded.
- Ensure that there are no restrictive security settings or JVM arguments that might prevent Mockito from loading or initializing correctly.

Addressing these points should help in resolving the initialization issue with Mockito and allow the unit test to run as expected.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void getProductByIdWithInvalidId() {
    when(productRepository.findById(any())).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
    ResponseEntity<Product> response = productController.getProductById(999L);
    assertEquals(404, response.getStatusCodeValue());
}

The failure of the test method `getProductByIdWithNullId` in the `ProductControllerGetProductByIdTest` class is primarily due to an issue with the initialization of the Mockito framework, which is extensively used for mocking objects in unit tests. The specific error `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.mockito.Mockito` suggests that the Mockito class could not be found or properly loaded during the runtime of the test. This is a critical error and prevents any Mockito-related functionalities from being executed.

The root cause of this error is typically related to one of the following:
1. **Dependency Issues**: The Mockito library might not be correctly included or resolved in the project's dependencies. This can happen if the Mockito dependency is missing from the `pom.xml` file, if there's a version conflict between multiple dependencies that use Mockito, or if the repository from which Mockito is being fetched is not accessible or is incorrect.

2. **Classpath Issues**: The Mockito classes are not found in the classpath during the execution of the test. This could be due to misconfiguration in the build script or IDE settings where the test classes are compiled and executed.

3. **Corrupted Mockito Library**: Occasionally, the downloaded Mockito jar might be corrupted during download or storage, which could lead to `NoClassDefFoundError`.

To resolve this issue, you should:
- Ensure that the Mockito dependency is correctly declared in your `pom.xml` with the appropriate version.
- Check that your build tool (like Maven or Gradle) is correctly configured to include the Mockito library in the classpath during the test phase.
- Clean and rebuild your project to ensure all dependencies are fetched and stored correctly.
- If the problem persists, try clearing the local repository cache or download the dependency again.

This issue is unrelated to the logic of the `getProductById` method itself but is critical to the execution of the test that validates this logic. By resolving the Mockito initialization issue, the test should be able to run and validate the method's behavior correctly.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void getProductByIdWithNullId() {
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        productController.getProductById(null);
    });
}

/*
The failure of the test method `getProductByIdWhenRepositoryThrowsException` is caused by a critical issue related to the Mockito framework used in the testing environment. Specifically, the test failure is attributed to a `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError` for the `org.mockito.Mockito` class. This error suggests that the Mockito class could not be initialized, which is a fundamental problem that prevents Mockito from functioning correctly.

This issue typically arises due to problems with the classpath configuration where the Mockito library might not be properly included or there might be conflicting versions of Mockito or its dependencies. Additionally, the error is wrapped in an `ExceptionInInitializerError`, which indicates that an unexpected exception occurred during the static initialization of a class or interface, or the initializer for a static variable.

To resolve this test failure, one should ensure the following:
1. **Correct Dependency Management**: Verify that the correct version of Mockito and its dependencies are included in the project's build configuration file (such as `pom.xml` for Maven projects). It’s important to ensure there are no conflicting versions of the libraries that could lead to such initialization errors.
2. **Classpath Configuration**: Check that the classpath during the test execution includes all necessary Mockito libraries. This can be confirmed by inspecting the build configuration or the IDE settings.
3. **Library Compatibility**: Sometimes, newer or older versions of libraries might not be fully compatible with other dependencies or the Java version being used. Testing with different versions of Mockito or updating other related libraries might resolve the issue.

By addressing these aspects, the initialization error related to Mockito should be resolved, allowing the unit test to execute as intended and either pass or fail based on the logic within the test itself, rather than failing due to environmental or configuration issues.
@Test
@Tag("integration")
public void getProductByIdWhenRepositoryThrowsException() {

    });
}
