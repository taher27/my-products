 * """ Scenario 1: Test getProductById with valid ID Details: TestName:
 * getProductWithValidId Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns
 * the correct product when provided with a valid ID. Execution: Arrange: Mock the
 * ProductRepository to return a Product when findById is called with a valid ID. Act:
 * Invoke getProductById with a valid ID. Assert: Check if the returned ResponseEntity
 * contains the expected Product and the status is OK. Validation: This assertion verifies
 * that the method can retrieve a product by its ID and return it correctly. It is
 * significant because it validates the basic functionality of the method.
 *
 * Scenario 2: Test getProductById with invalid ID Details: TestName:
 * getProductWithInvalidId Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles
 * a request for a product that does not exist in the repository. Execution: Arrange: Mock
 * the ProductRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an
 * invalid ID. Act: Invoke getProductById with an invalid ID. Assert: Check if the
 * returned ResponseEntity has a NOT_FOUND status. Validation: This assertion verifies
 * that the method correctly handles a request for a non-existent product. This is
 * important as it tests the method's error handling capabilities.
 *
 * Scenario 3: Test getProductById with null ID Details: TestName: getProductWithNullId
 * Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a request with a null
 * ID. Execution: Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the ID passed is null. Act: Invoke
 * getProductById with a null ID. Assert: Check if the method throws an
 * IllegalArgumentException. Validation: This assertion verifies that the method rejects a
 * null ID. This is important as it ensures that the method does not accept invalid input.
 *
 * Scenario 4: Test getProductById when ProductRepository throws an exception Details:
 * TestName: getProductWhenRepositoryThrowsException Description: This test is meant to
 * check how the method handles an exception thrown by the ProductRepository. Execution:
 * Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to throw an exception when findById is called. Act:
 * Invoke getProductById with a valid ID. Assert: Check if the method throws the same
 * exception. Validation: This assertion verifies that the method correctly propagates
 * exceptions thrown by the ProductRepository. This is important as it tests the method's
 * error handling capabilities. """
