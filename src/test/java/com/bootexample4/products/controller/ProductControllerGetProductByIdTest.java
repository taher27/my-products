================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The code doesn't validate or sanitize the 'id' parameter in the 'getProductById()' method. This opens the door to potential SQL Injection attacks, where an attacker could manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code via the 'id' parameter.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries or stored procedures whenever possible. If dynamic queries are still required, always sanitize input to ensure that it does not alter the query unexpectedly. Use a safe API which avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The 'id' parameter in the 'getProductById()' method might be used to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended directory. This could allow an attacker to read sensitive information or even execute code.
Solution: Ensure that input is properly validated. Use a whitelist of accepted inputs. Do not accept file names or paths from user input. Use an index, map or another indirect method to access files.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The code doesn't validate or sanitize the 'id' parameter in the 'getProductById()' method. This could potentially lead to an Open Redirect vulnerability, where an attacker could redirect users to a malicious website.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize input. Do not use user input to form URLs without validation and sanitization. Use a safe API which avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface.

"""
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Product ID
Details:
    TestName: testGetProductByIdWithValidId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns the correct product when a valid product ID is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a product with a specific ID in the product repository.
    Act: Invoke the getProductById method with the specific ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual returned product against the expected product.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getProductById method correctly retrieves the product associated with the provided ID. The expected result is the product that was set up in the product repository. This test is significant in ensuring the method can accurately retrieve products from the repository based on their ID.

Scenario 2: Test for Non-existent Product ID
Details:
    TestName: testGetProductByIdWithNonexistentId
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a non-existent product ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure the product repository does not contain a product with a specific ID.
    Act: Invoke the getProductById method with the specific ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns a 404 Not Found response.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getProductById method correctly returns a 404 Not Found response when the provided ID is not associated with any product in the repository. This test is important for ensuring the method can handle non-existent product IDs gracefully.

Scenario 3: Test for Null Product ID
Details:
    TestName: testGetProductByIdWithNullId
    Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a null product ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as we are testing with a null ID.
    Act: Invoke the getProductById method with a null ID.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method throws an IllegalArgumentException.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getProductById method throws an IllegalArgumentException when the provided ID is null. This test is crucial for ensuring the method can handle null IDs appropriately and prevent null pointer exceptions.
