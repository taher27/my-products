================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getDescription() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, or proxy servers.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in GET requests. If necessary, use HTTP POST requests instead.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getDescription() method could have been used for debugging purposes and accidentally left in the production code. This can expose sensitive information or internal workings of the application.
Solution: Always remove debug code or make sure it's properly managed by using feature flags or a similar strategy. Also, consider using a tool to detect leftover debug code.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getDescription() method could be exposing sensitive information if it's not properly managed. This can lead to privacy violations.
Solution: Review the data returned by getDescription(). If it contains sensitive information, consider modifying the method to return non-sensitive data, or implement access controls to restrict who can call the method.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Return of Description

Details:
  TestName: testValidReturnOfDescription
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getDescription() method returns the correct description as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a description in the object.
    Act: Invoke the getDescription() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the description returned by the method is as expected. The expected result is based on the set up description. This test is significant in ensuring that the getDescription() method is functioning correctly and returning the correct description.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Return of Description

Details:
  TestName: testNullReturnOfDescription
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getDescription() method returns null when the description is not set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not set up a description in the object.
    Act: Invoke the getDescription() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned description is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the description returned by the method is null if no description is set. This test is significant in ensuring that the getDescription() method is handling the case where no description is set correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for Empty Return of Description

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyReturnOfDescription
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getDescription() method returns an empty string when the description is set as an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an empty description in the object.
    Act: Invoke the getDescription() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned description is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the description returned by the method is an empty string if the description is set as such. This test is significant in ensuring that the getDescription() method is handling the case where the description is set as an empty string correctly.
