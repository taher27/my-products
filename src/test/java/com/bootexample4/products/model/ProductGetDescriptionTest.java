================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
Issue: The function getDescription() is public and may expose sensitive data if the 'description' variable is not handled properly.
Solution: Consider making the function protected or private if it is not necessary to expose it. Also ensure that the 'description' variable does not hold any sensitive data.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: We cannot see data validations on the fields, as only the 'getDescription' method code is visible. If the description value originates from user input or external sources, there is a risk of injection attacks.
Solution: Consider using proper input validation techniques on user or externally supplied values. Also, avoid any potential injections by using prepared statements, parameterized queries, or ORM libraries.

Vulnerability: SQL injection (CWE-89)
Issue: If the 'description' variable is used in crafting SQL queries directly, it might open up the risk of SQL injection.
Solution: Avoid crafting SQL queries by concatenating user inputs. Instead, use prepared statement or ORM libraries to create SQL queries.

"""
  Scenario 1: Successful Return of Description

  Details:
    TestName: testGetDescriptionSuccess.
    Description: The test is meant to check the successful execution of the getDescription method. Specifically, it aims to verify that the method returns the correct description after it has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a description (private instance variable) with a known string.
    Act: Invoke the getDescription method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the return value of the method with the known string used to initialize the description.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getDescription method correctly returns the string used to initialize the description. This is vital as it proves the method's correctness in retrieving the instance variable's value.

  Scenario 2: Null Return of Description

  Details:
    TestName: testGetDescriptionReturnNull.
    Description: The test aims to check the getDescription method when no description has been set, i.e., when the description is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not initialize a description, leaving it as null.
    Act: Invoke the getDescription method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the method returns null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getDescription method correctly returns null when the description is not initialized with a string. It is significant as it confirms the method's behavior in scenarios where the description hasn't been explicitly set.
