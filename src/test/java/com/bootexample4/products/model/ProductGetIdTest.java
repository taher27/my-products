Scenario 1: Testing getId method when the id field is null

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdWhenIdIsNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the getId method when the id field is null. The expected result is null because the id field is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the id field is already null.
  Act: Invoke the getId method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned id is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method correctly returns null when the id field is null. This is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the getId method behaves correctly when the id is not set.

Scenario 2: Testing getId method when the id field is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdWhenIdIsSet
  Description: This test is meant to check the getId method when the id field is set. The expected result is the value of the id because the id field is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the id field to a specific value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned id is equal to the set id.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method correctly returns the value of the id when the id field is set. This is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the getId method behaves correctly when the id is set.

Scenario 3: Testing getId method when the id field is set to a large value

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdWhenIdIsLarge
  Description: This test is meant to check the getId method when the id field is set to a large value. The expected result is the value of the id because the id field is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the id field to a large value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned id is equal to the set id.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method correctly returns the value of the id when the id field is set to a large value. This is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the getId method can handle large id values.
