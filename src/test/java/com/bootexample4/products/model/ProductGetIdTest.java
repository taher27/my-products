Scenario 1: Test to Validate the Product ID Value
Details:
  TestName: testProductId
  Description: The test is designed to check if the getId() method successfully returns the product ID which was previously set using setId() method. The target scenario is when an ID is assigned to a product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class. Use the setId() method to assign an ID to the product.
  Act: Invoke the getId() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned ID matches the ID that was set previously.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId() method is implemented correctly and is able to retrieve the product's ID as expected. This is essential as the method is crucial for the proper functioning of the application, as product IDs are used to identify different products.

Scenario 2: Validate the Default ID Value
Details:
  TestName: testDefaultIdValue
  Description: The objective is to verify that the default value of product ID is null when no ID is set explicitly. The test checks the getId() method's return value upon the application's initialization, before any ID is set using setId() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object without setting an ID.
  Act: Call the getId() method.
  Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to confirm that the returned ID is null.
Validation:
  The goal of this assertion is to verify that the default ID value is null. Ensuring that the ID remains null until explicitly set is necessary for maintaining the data integrity of the application.

Scenario 3: Test with Providing Null as Product ID
Details:
  TestName: testNullId
  Description: This test is used to check how the getId() method behaves when null is provided as a product ID via setId().
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and use the setId() method to set the ID to null.
  Act: Invoke the getId() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to confirm that the returned ID is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method handles null values gracefully. The functionality to handle nullation is crucial because it ensures that the application can successfully deal with scenarios wherein an ID is not provided.
