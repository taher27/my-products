================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Sensitive data exposure
Issue: If this method relates to sensitive information (like a user ID in a user class), direct access to the getId method could potentially expose sensitive data.
Solution: Consider restricting direct access to the getId method. Ensure that there's a control mechanism for who can access and modify this data.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If this ID is exposed in your application, such as in a URL or a POST parameter, this could allow an attacker to manipulate the ID to gain unauthorized access to records.
Solution: Avoid exposing direct object references to the client. Instead, utilize indirect object references. Also, always validate user's authorization to the accessed data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Scenario

Details:
    TestName: testGetIdPositiveScenario.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of getId() method. It should return the id which has been assigned.
 Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a User Entity and assign an ID.
    Act: Invoke getId() method on the User entity.
    Assert: Using JUnit assertions, compare the actual result against the assigned id.
 Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that getId() method works as expected. If the method is working properly, it should return the id that has been assigned to it. The success of this test validates the basic functionality of the getId() method.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Scenario

Details:
    TestName: testGetIdWhenNull.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of getId() method when the id has not been set and is null.
 Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a User Entity without assigning an ID.
    Act: Invoke getId() method on the User entity.
    Assert: Using JUnit assertions, compare the actual result which should be null, against the expected outcome which is also null.
 Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that getId() method works correctly when the id has not been assigned and is null. If the method is working properly, it should return null. This test validates the functionality of the getId() method when the id is null.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero Scenario

Details:
    TestName: testGetIdWhenZero.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of getId() method when the id has been set to zero.
 Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a User Entity and assign an ID as zero.
    Act: Invoke getId() method on the User Entity.
    Assert: Using JUnit assertions, compare the actual result, which should be zero, against the expected outcome, which is also zero.
 Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that getId() method works correctly when the id has been set as zero. If the method is working properly, it should return zero. This test validates the functionality of the getId() method when the id is zero.
