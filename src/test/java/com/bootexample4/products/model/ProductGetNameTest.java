================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The code provided does not appear to sanitize or validate input, which can lead to information exposure. For example, a user may be able to manipulate the 'name' value in a GET request, potentially resulting in the exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that all input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent manipulation. This could be achieved by using a library such as OWASP's Java Encoder for Java.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The 'name' value is being returned directly without any form of access control in place. This could potentially result in the exposure of private information.
Solution: Implement access control checks to ensure that users can only access data that they are authorized to view.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code provided appears to be a snippet from a larger codebase, and as such it may contain debug code that could expose sensitive information if left in a production environment.
Solution: Ensure that all debug code is removed from the production environment. This can be achieved by using a code review tool or static analysis tool to identify and remove leftover debug code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for the default name

Details:
TestName: testDefaultName
Description: This test is meant to check the default name returned by the getName() method when no name has been set.
Execution:
Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no name has been set.
Act: Invoke the getName() method.
Assert: Assert that the returned name is null or the default name set in the class.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getName() method correctly returns the default value when no name has been set. This test is significant as it checks the default behavior of the getName() method.

Scenario 2: Test for the name after setting a value

Details:
TestName: testNameAfterSettingValue
Description: This test is meant to check the name returned by the getName() method after a name has been set using the setName() method.
Execution:
Arrange: Set a name using the setName() method.
Act: Invoke the getName() method.
Assert: Assert that the returned name is equal to the name that was set.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getName() method correctly returns the name that was set. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the getName() method after a name has been set.

Scenario 3: Test for the name after setting it to null

Details:
TestName: testNameAfterSettingNull
Description: This test is meant to check the name returned by the getName() method after the name has been set to null.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the name to null using the setName() method.
Act: Invoke the getName() method.
Assert: Assert that the returned name is null.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getName() method correctly returns null when the name has been set to null. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the getName() method when dealing with null values.

Scenario 4: Test for the name after setting it to an empty string

Details:
TestName: testNameAfterSettingEmptyString
Description: This test is meant to check the name returned by the getName() method after the name has been set to an empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the name to an empty string using the setName() method.
Act: Invoke the getName() method.
Assert: Assert that the returned name is an empty string.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getName() method correctly returns an empty string when the name has been set to an empty string. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the getName() method when dealing with empty strings.
