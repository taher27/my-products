================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various locations, including the user's browser, the web server, and any forward or reverse proxy servers between the two endpoints.
Solution: It's recommended to use HTTP POST requests instead of GET for any request that involves sensitive data. Also, consider using HTTPS to encrypt the data during transmission.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Exposing internal workings of the application like the price can lead to information disclosure vulnerability. This can provide an attacker with valuable information about the system and how it works.
Solution: Consider encapsulating the price field and only exposing necessary information through controlled methods. Use access modifiers to restrict direct access to the field.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: If the price is related to private personal information, there is a risk of exposing such information to unauthorized actors which may lead to privacy violation.
Solution: Ensure that any personal information is properly secured and only accessible to authorized entities. Review the code to verify that proper access controls are in place.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is functioning as expected. The expected result is the correct price value. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method returns the correct value as it might be used in several places in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a default value when the price is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDefaultValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a default value (like 0 or null) when the price is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price to null or not set it at all.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected value (0 or null).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method can handle the scenario where the price is not set. The expected result is a default value. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method does not throw an exception or return an incorrect value when the price is not set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns a negative price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsNegativeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method can return a negative price (if the business logic allows for a negative price).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price to a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected negative value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method can handle negative price values. The expected result is the negative price value. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle all possible price values.
