================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose sensitive information through query strings in GET requests if it's used in a web application context. This could lead to information disclosure to unauthorized users.
Solution: Avoid passing sensitive data in the URL. Use POST requests instead of GET requests if sensitive data is involved.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose private information if it's used without any access control mechanism in place. This could lead to unauthorized access to private data.
Solution: Implement access control mechanisms to protect private data. Make sure that only authorized users can access sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the getPrice() method is used for debugging purposes and is not removed in the production environment, it could expose sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that all debug code is removed or disabled in the production environment.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getPrice() returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns the correct price value that has been previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class and set the price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the set price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice() method correctly retrieves the price value. The expected result is the price that was set during the Arrange phase. This is significant as it ensures the getPrice() method is functioning as intended.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getPrice() returns zero when no price has been set

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsZeroWhenNoPriceSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns zero when no price has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class without setting the price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice() method returns zero when no price has been set. This is significant as it ensures the getPrice() method is functioning as expected when no price has been set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getPrice() returns a negative value when the price set is negative

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsNegativeWhenPriceSetNegative
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns a negative value when the price set is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class and set the price to a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price against the negative value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice() method returns the negative value that was set. This is significant as it ensures the getPrice() method is functioning as expected when a negative price has been set.
