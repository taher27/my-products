================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, or proxy servers.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in HTTP GET requests. Use HTTP POST requests instead or encrypt the data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getPrice() method could potentially be debug code that was left over. If this method is not meant to be in production code, it could expose sensitive information or functionality.
Solution: Ensure that debug code is not left in production code. Use logging and exception handling for error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method exposes private information that could be exploited by an attacker. This could lead to a violation of user privacy.
Solution: Ensure that private information is not exposed unnecessarily. Use access modifiers such as 'private' or 'protected' to limit access to sensitive data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Positive Return Value

Details:
    TestName: testGetPriceReturnPositiveValue
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns a positive value as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the price to a positive value.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned value is the same as the set price.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the getPrice() method correctly returns the price set before. The expected result is a positive value matching the set price, as the price in a real-world scenario would be a positive number.

Scenario 2: Test for Zero Return Value

Details:
    TestName: testGetPriceReturnZero
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns zero when the price is not set or if it is set to zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class without setting the price or set the price to zero.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned value is zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the getPrice() method correctly returns zero when the price is not set or set to zero. This is significant because in some scenarios the price might not be set initially or it might be zero.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Return Value

Details:
    TestName: testGetPriceReturnNegativeValue
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns a negative value when the price is set to a negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the price to a negative value.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned value is the same as the set negative price.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the getPrice() method correctly returns the price set before, even if it's a negative number. The expected result is a negative value matching the set price. This test might seem unnecessary as prices are usually positive, but it's important to ensure the method behaves as expected in all scenarios.
