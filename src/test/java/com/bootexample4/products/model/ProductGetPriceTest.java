================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose sensitive information through query strings in GET requests if it's used in a web application context. This could lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed in query strings. Consider using HTTP POST method or encrypting sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method exposes the price details which might be sensitive information. If not properly handled, it can lead to privacy violation.
Solution: Consider making the getPrice() method private or protected, or consider the use of getter and setter methods with proper access control checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the getPrice() method is a debug method and was accidentally left in production code, it could expose sensitive information or system details.
Solution: Ensure to remove all debug code or control their execution with a debug flag that is off by default in production.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value matches the expected price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is functioning correctly and returning the expected price. This is important for ensuring accurate price information is provided.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a positive price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsPositiveValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a positive price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is a positive number.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method always returns a positive price, as prices cannot be negative. This is important for ensuring accurate and valid price information is provided.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns a price with the correct decimal places

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsValueWithCorrectDecimalPlaces
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a price value with the correct number of decimal places.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value has the correct number of decimal places.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method returns a price with the correct number of decimal places, as prices should be accurate to two decimal places. This is important for ensuring accurate and precise price information is provided.

Please note that these scenarios assume that the 'price' attribute is set correctly in the object. In an actual test class, you would have additional tests to confirm this.
