================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, or proxy servers.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in HTTP GET requests. Use HTTP POST requests instead or encrypt the data before sending.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method is public and might expose sensitive price information. An attacker can access this information without proper authorization.
Solution: Ensure proper access control measures are in place. Make the method private or protected and provide a secure public method to access it, if necessary.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the getPrice() method was used for debugging and left in the production code, it can expose sensitive information to an attacker.
Solution: Ensure to remove all debug code or guard it using a flag that is off during production.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value matches the expected price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is functioning correctly and returning the expected price. This is important for ensuring accurate price information is provided.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a positive price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsPositiveValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a positive price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is a positive number.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method always returns a positive price. This is crucial since a negative price would not make sense in a business context.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns a price with two decimal places

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsValueWithTwoDecimalPlaces
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a price value with two decimal places, which is standard for financial amounts.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value has two decimal places.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is returning a price with two decimal places. This is important for ensuring the price is presented in a format that is standard for financial amounts.
