================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, or proxy servers.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in HTTP GET requests. Use HTTP POST requests instead or encrypt the sensitive data before sending.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method is public which may lead to the exposure of sensitive information. If the price information is sensitive, it can be accessed by any class in the application.
Solution: Declare the getPrice() method as private or protected, or ensure that access to it is properly controlled and restricted to intended classes.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the getPrice() method is part of debug code, it may expose sensitive information or system internals which can be helpful for an attacker.
Solution: Ensure to remove all debug codes or guard them using debug flags which are turned off in the production environment.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for the correct price retrieval

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object and set a price value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Compare the returned value from getPrice() with the set price.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPrice() method is functioning correctly and returning the correct value. The outcome of this test is significant to ensure the correct price is retrieved when the method is called.

Scenario 2: Test for default price value

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceDefaultValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns the default price value when no price is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object without setting a price value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Compare the returned value from getPrice() with the default price value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPrice() method is functioning correctly and returning the default value when no price is set. This is significant to ensure that the method handles cases where the price has not been set.

Scenario 3: Test for negative price value

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceNegativeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns a negative price value when such a value is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object and set a negative price value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Compare the returned value from getPrice() with the set negative price.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPrice() method is functioning correctly and returning the negative price value. This is significant to ensure that the method can handle situations where the price is negative.

Scenario 4: Test for zero price value

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceZeroValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns a zero price value when such a value is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object and set a zero price value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Compare the returned value from getPrice() with zero.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPrice() method is functioning correctly and returning the zero price value. This is significant to ensure that the method can handle situations where the price is zero.
