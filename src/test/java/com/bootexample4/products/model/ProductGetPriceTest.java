================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose sensitive information through query strings in GET requests if it's used in a web application context. This could lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed through query strings. Consider using HTTP POST method or encrypting sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getPrice() method might be a leftover debug code that could expose sensitive information. Debug code can create unintended entry points in an application.
Solution: Always remove debug code or any code that is not meant for production when deploying applications. Use logging mechanisms for debugging.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the getPrice() method is used to get the price of a private or sensitive product, it might violate privacy rules. This could lead to legal issues.
Solution: Ensure that privacy rules are respected. Consider adding access controls or anonymizing data.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose sensitive information if it's used without proper access controls. This could lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed without proper access controls. Consider using authentication and authorization mechanisms.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value matches the expected price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is functioning correctly and returning the expected price. This is important for ensuring accurate price information is provided.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a positive price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsPositiveValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a positive price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is a positive number.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method always returns a positive price, as prices cannot be negative. This is important for ensuring accurate and valid price information is provided.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns a price with the correct decimal places

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsValueWithCorrectDecimalPlaces
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a price value with the correct number of decimal places.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value has the correct number of decimal places.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method returns a price with the correct number of decimal places, as prices should be accurate to two decimal places. This is important for ensuring accurate and precise price information is provided.
