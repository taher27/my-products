================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, or data analytics.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in HTTP GET requests. Use HTTP POST requests or secure cookies when sending sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method might be exposing sensitive information that can be accessed by other classes or methods. This could lead to data leakage.
Solution: Make the getPrice() method private or protected, and provide a secure way to access it. This can be achieved by using getter and setter methods, and by performing necessary checks or validations.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the getPrice() method is part of debug code, it might expose sensitive information in production environment.
Solution: Ensure to remove or disable debug code before deploying the application to production environment.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If an error occurs while executing the getPrice() method, and the error message is not handled properly, it might expose sensitive information.
Solution: Handle exceptions properly and avoid exposing sensitive information through error messages. Use a centralized exception handling mechanism.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value matches the expected price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is functioning correctly and returning the expected price. This is important for ensuring accurate price information is provided.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a positive price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsPositiveValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a positive price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is a positive number.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method always returns a positive price, as prices cannot be negative. This is important for ensuring accurate and valid price information is provided.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns a price with the correct decimal places

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsValueWithCorrectDecimalPlaces
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a price value with the correct number of decimal places.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value has the correct number of decimal places.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method returns a price with the correct number of decimal places, as prices should be accurate to two decimal places. This is important for ensuring accurate price information is provided.
