"""
  Scenario 1: Test to see if the price of a product can be retrieved successfully

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceRetrieval
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method in the Product class is able to retrieve the price that was set for a product. The target scenario is to ensure that the price field is accurately getting from the product object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a product object using the Product class, and set the price using the setPrice method.
    Act: Retrieve the price of the product using the getPrice method.
    Assert: Compare the retrieved price with the price that was set using JUnit assertions.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the retrieved price is equal to the price that was set. The expected result is that the two values will be equal. This test is essential as the getProduct method is used to retrieve the price of the product in various parts of the system, and such, correct functioning is necessary.

  Scenario 2: Testing proper functioning when no price has been set.

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceRetrievalWithNoPriceSet
    Description: This scenario is meant to check if the getPrice method can handle a case where the price has not been set for a product. The application should not crash, and a default value (null) should be retrieved.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a product object using the Product class without setting a price.
    Act: Retrieve the price of the product using the getPrice method.
    Assert: Check if the retrieved price is null using JUnit assertions.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to check if the retrieved price is null which would imply that no price was set for the product which is expected. This is important to ensure the system can handle a scenario where no price is set without crashing.

  Scenario 3: Testing product price set and retrieved multiple times.

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceReset
    Description: This test case is to check if the price can be reset to a new value. This will test the ability of the getPrice method to show the updated price.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a product object using the Product class and set a price. Then reset the price to a new value.
    Act: Use the getPrice method to retrieve the updated price.
    Assert: Check if the retrieved price matches the updated price using JUnit assertions.
  Validation:
    This assertion is meant to confirm that the updated price is correctly retrieved. This is important because in certain situations in real-world applications, the price of a product can be updated. The getPrice method should be able to handle this change.
