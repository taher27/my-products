================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, or proxy servers.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in HTTP GET requests. Use HTTP POST requests instead or encrypt the data before sending.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getPrice() method might be part of a debug code left in the production environment. If the debug code is not properly secured, it can expose sensitive information to an attacker.
Solution: Remove all debug code or make sure it is properly secured before deploying the application to the production environment.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The getPrice() method might throw exceptions that are not properly handled. This can expose sensitive information through error messages.
Solution: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions properly. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used to access private information. If the data is not properly secured, it can expose private information to an attacker.
Solution: Make sure that all data is properly secured. Use access control mechanisms to restrict access to private information.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getPrice() returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns the correct price value that has been previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a price value and set it using the setter method (if exists) or during object creation.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the set price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice() method correctly retrieves the price value. The expected result is the same as the value set before the method call. This is crucial for the accurate representation of price data in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getPrice() returns default value when no price has been set

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDefaultWhenUnset
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns the default value when no price has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set a price value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the default price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice() method correctly returns the default price value when no price has been set. The expected result is the default price value. This is important for handling cases where price data may not be available.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getPrice() handles null price values

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceHandlesNullValues
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method can handle null price values without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price value to null.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that no exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice() method can handle null values gracefully. The expected result is that no exception is thrown. This is important for robust error handling in the application.
