"""
Scenario 1: Testing the default value of the price
Details:  
  TestName: testDefaultPriceValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the default price is null before any value is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this test as we're checking the default state.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned price is null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the price is null by default. This is important because we want to ensure that prices aren't accidentally set to a non-null value upon object creation.

Scenario 2: Testing the value of the price after it has been set
Details:  
  TestName: testPriceValueAfterSetting
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns the correct value after the price has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the price to a specific value.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned price is the same as the value set.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the price is correctly set and retrieved. This is important as it ensures the getPrice() method functions correctly.

Scenario 3: Testing the value of the price with a negative number
Details:  
  TestName: testNegativePriceValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method can handle negative values correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the price to a negative value.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned price is the same as the negative value set.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the getPrice() method can handle negative values. This is important as it ensures the method's robustness and error handling capabilities.

Scenario 4: Testing the value of the price with zero
Details:  
  TestName: testZeroPriceValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method can handle a price of zero correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the price to zero.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned price is zero.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the getPrice() method can handle a price of zero. This is important as it ensures the method's robustness and error handling capabilities.
