================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, etc., causing potential information leakage.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in GET requests. If this method is used in such a context, consider changing it to a POST request or encrypting the data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getPrice() method may be a leftover from debugging. If this method is not required in production, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Review the code to ensure unnecessary debug code is removed before the application is deployed.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method is public and may expose sensitive price information. If this data is confidential, making it publicly accessible can lead to a privacy violation.
Solution: Consider changing the access modifier of the getPrice() method to private or protected, and provide controlled access through getter and setter methods.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for the basic functionality of the getPrice method

Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceBasicFunctionality
  Description: This test is meant to check the basic functionality of the getPrice method. The target scenario is when the getPrice method is called on an object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a known price. 
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the created object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the return value of the method with the known price of the object.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the getPrice method returns the correct price of the object. The expected result is the known price of the object. The significance of this test is to ensure that the getPrice method is working as expected in the most basic scenario.

Scenario 2: Test for the getPrice method when the price is zero

Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceWhenPriceIsZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getPrice method when the price of the object is zero. The target scenario is when the getPrice method is called on an object with a zero price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a price of zero.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the created object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the return value of the method with zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the getPrice method returns zero when the price of the object is zero. The expected result is zero. The significance of this test is to ensure that the getPrice method works correctly when the price is zero.

Scenario 3: Test for the getPrice method when the price is negative

Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceWhenPriceIsNegative
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getPrice method when the price of the object is negative. The target scenario is when the getPrice method is called on an object with a negative price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a negative price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the created object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the return value of the method with the negative price.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the getPrice method returns the negative price when the price of the object is negative. The expected result is the negative price. The significance of this test is to ensure that the getPrice method works correctly when the price is negative.
