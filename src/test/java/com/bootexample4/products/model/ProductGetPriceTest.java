### Scenario 1: Test getPrice with Default Value
Details:
  TestName: getPriceWithDefaultValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getPrice method when the price has not been explicitly set. It should return the default value, typically 0.0 for a double data type, assuming no constructor or initializer sets a different value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the newly created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to 0.0.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the default state of price is 0.0, which is crucial to ensure that uninitialized Product objects have a predictable price value. This test is significant to confirm system stability and prevent unexpected behavior in financial calculations where default values are critical.

### Scenario 2: Test getPrice with Positive Value
Details:
  TestName: getPriceWithPositiveValue
  Description: This test verifies the getPrice method when the price is set to a positive value. It ensures that the method correctly returns the value that has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product and set a positive price value using setPrice.
  Act: Call the getPrice method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price matches the value set earlier.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that getPrice accurately retrieves the exact value stored in the price field. This test is significant to ensure that the product pricing is correctly managed and reported within the application, reflecting accurate financial information.

### Scenario 3: Test getPrice with Negative Value
Details:
  TestName: getPriceWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of getPrice when a negative value is set. This scenario might occur due to a data error or special pricing scenarios like rebates or adjustments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product and use setPrice to assign a negative value.
  Act: Call getPrice on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is the negative value set earlier.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that getPrice can handle and return negative values, which might be used in specific business scenarios or error conditions. This test is crucial for validating that the system can accurately handle and represent all types of price data, including potential error states or special discounting mechanisms.

### Scenario 4: Test getPrice with Extremely Large Value
Details:
  TestName: getPriceWithExtremelyLargeValue
  Description: This test ensures that the getPrice method can handle and return extremely large values, testing the upper boundaries of data type limits.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set an extremely large price using setPrice.
  Act: Retrieve the price using getPrice.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the extremely large value set.
Validation:
  The assertion tests the ability of the system to handle large monetary values without data loss or corruption, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity in high-value transactions. This test helps ensure that the application can operate reliably with large financial figures.

### Scenario 5: Test getPrice after Multiple Updates
Details:
  TestName: getPriceAfterMultipleUpdates
  Description: This test checks the getPrice method's reliability after multiple updates to the price, ensuring that the most recent update is what getPrice returns.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance, set a price, update it multiple times with different values.
  Act: Call getPrice on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price matches the last value set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that getPrice consistently returns the most recent price value, which is essential for applications where price updates are frequent, ensuring that the displayed or calculated price is always current and accurate. This test confirms the robustness of the Product class's handling of dynamic data changes.
