================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, etc., causing potential information leakage.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in GET requests. If this method is used in such a context, consider changing it to a POST request or encrypting the sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getPrice() method might be a leftover debug code. If the debug code is left in the production environment, it might expose sensitive information or system internals.
Solution: Ensure to remove all debug codes before moving to the production environment. Use logging frameworks that can be easily configured to disable debug statements in production.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method may expose private information if the price is considered sensitive in the context of the application. It can be misused by malicious users to gain unauthorized access to this information.
Solution: Consider limiting access to this method based on user roles or permissions. Also, consider implementing an audit log to track accesses.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value matches the expected price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is functioning correctly and returning the expected price. This is important for ensuring accurate price information is provided.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a positive price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsPositiveValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a positive price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is a positive number.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method always returns a positive price. This is crucial since a negative price would not make sense in a business context.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns a price with two decimal places

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsValueWithTwoDecimalPlaces
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a price value with two decimal places, which is standard for financial amounts.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value has two decimal places.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is returning a price with two decimal places. This is important for ensuring the price is presented in a format that is standard for financial amounts.
