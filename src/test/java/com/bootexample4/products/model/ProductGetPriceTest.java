================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose sensitive information through query strings in GET requests if it's used in a web application context. This could lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed in query strings. Consider using POST requests or secure methods of data transmission.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method is public, which means it can be accessed from any class in the application. If the price data is sensitive and should not be exposed to all classes, this could be a privacy violation.
Solution: Consider making the getPrice() method private or protected, or controlling access to it with appropriate permissions.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: If the price data is used in a context where it should be kept confidential, the getPrice() method could expose that information because it does not have any control mechanisms in place.
Solution: Consider implementing control mechanisms, such as authentication and authorization, to protect the data accessed by the getPrice() method.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is functioning as expected and returning the correct price.
  This test is significant as it ensures the correct price is returned, which is crucial for accurate financial calculations in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a positive price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsPositiveValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a positive price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the price returned is a positive value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is returning a positive price, as negative prices are not valid in this context.
  This test is significant as it ensures the application does not return or process negative prices, which could lead to financial inaccuracies.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns a zero price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a price value of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the price returned is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method can return a price of zero, which might be valid in specific scenarios (e.g., promotional items).
  This test is significant as it ensures the application can handle scenarios where the price might be zero correctly.

Scenario 4: Test to check if the method returns a price with decimal values

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDecimalValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a price with decimal values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the price returned has decimal values.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method can return a price with decimal values, as prices often have cents.
  This test is significant as it ensures the application accurately returns prices with decimal places, which is crucial for precise financial calculations.
