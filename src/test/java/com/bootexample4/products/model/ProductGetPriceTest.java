================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various locations, increasing the risk of it being viewed by unauthorized actors.
Solution: Avoid transmitting sensitive information through GET requests. Use POST requests instead or encrypt the sensitive data before transmitting.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used for debugging purposes and forgotten to be removed, which can expose system internals to an attacker.
Solution: Ensure to remove any debug code or information used during development phase that could expose sensitive system information.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: If the getPrice() method is used to transmit sensitive data over network without encryption, it can be intercepted and read by attackers.
Solution: Always use secure connections like HTTPS for transmission of sensitive data over network. Consider using encryption algorithms to encrypt the data before transmission.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getPrice() returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method is returning the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price value against the set price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice() method is working correctly and returning the expected price value. The significance of the test is to ensure that the price information returned by the method is accurate.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getPrice() returns a default value when the price is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDefaultValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method is returning a default value when the price is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set a price value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price value against the default price value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice() method is returning a default value when the price is not set. The significance of the test is to ensure that the method does not return an incorrect or unexpected value when the price is not explicitly set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getPrice() returns a zero when the price is set to zero

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method is returning zero when the price is set to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price value to zero.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price value with zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice() method is returning zero when the price is set to zero. The significance of the test is to ensure that the method is capable of returning zero as a valid price value, representing free or no-cost items.
