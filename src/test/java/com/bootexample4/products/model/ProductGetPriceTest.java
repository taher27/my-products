"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is functioning as expected and returning the correct price.
  This test is significant as it ensures the integrity of the price retrieval process, which is crucial for the application's pricing logic.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a positive price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsPositiveValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a positive price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned price is greater than zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is returning a positive value, assuming that prices cannot be negative.
  This test is significant as it ensures that the application's pricing logic is not flawed, which could lead to incorrect pricing.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns a price of zero

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a price of zero, assuming that there could be items with no cost.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned price is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method can handle and return a zero price.
  This test is significant as it ensures that the application's pricing logic can handle items with no cost.

Scenario 4: Test to check if the method returns a double value

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDoubleValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a value of type double.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned price is of type double.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is returning a value of type double.
  This test is significant as it ensures that the application's pricing logic is correctly handling the price data type.
