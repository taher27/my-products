================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose sensitive information through query strings in GET requests if it's used in a web application context. This could lead to potential information leakage and unauthorized data access.
Solution: Use POST requests instead of GET for sending sensitive data. If GET requests are unavoidable, ensure the sensitive data is properly encrypted.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method might lead to exposure of private information if it's used to access sensitive data. An attacker could potentially use this to gain unauthorized access to private data.
Solution: Ensure that the getPrice() method is used responsibly, with appropriate access controls in place. Use Java's built-in access control mechanisms, or a third-party library, to limit access to sensitive data.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getPrice() returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method accurately returns the price of the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a known price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price matches the known price of the object.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice() method accurately retrieves the price of the object. This is important as it impacts how the price is displayed and calculated in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getPrice() returns a non-negative value

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsNonNegativeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method never returns a negative value, as price should always be non-negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a known non-negative price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is non-negative.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice() method does not return a negative value. This is significant as it prevents any potential issues with negative pricing in the application.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getPrice() returns a value of type double

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDoubleValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice() method returns a value of type double.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a known price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is of type double.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice() method returns a value of type double. This is significant as it ensures consistency in the data type used for pricing across the application.
