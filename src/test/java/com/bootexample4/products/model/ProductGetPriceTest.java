================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information through URLs. This information can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, or proxy servers.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in HTTP GET requests. Use HTTP POST requests instead or encrypt the sensitive data before sending.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method is public which may lead to the exposure of sensitive information. If this method is used to get the price of a sensitive product, it can be accessed by any class in the application or outside of it.
Solution: Consider making the method protected or package-private, or encapsulate it within a class that manages access to sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the getPrice() method was used for debugging and is no longer necessary, it can pose a security risk. Debug code can expose sensitive information and internal system details.
Solution: Always remove debug code or turn it off before deploying the application. Keep production code and debug code separate if possible.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value matches the expected price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is functioning correctly and returning the expected price. This is important for ensuring accurate price information is provided.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a positive price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsPositiveValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a positive price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is a positive number.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method always returns a positive price. This is crucial since a negative price would not make sense in a business context.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns a price with two decimal places

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsValueWithTwoDecimalPlaces
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a price value with two decimal places, which is standard for financial amounts.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value has two decimal places.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is returning a price with two decimal places. This is important for ensuring the price is presented in a format that is standard for financial amounts.
