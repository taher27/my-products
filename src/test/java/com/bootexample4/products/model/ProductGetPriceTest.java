================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose sensitive information through query strings in GET requests if it's used in a web application context. This could lead to potential information leakage.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not exposed through HTTP GET requests. Use POST requests or other methods to transmit sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose private information if it's used without any access control mechanism in place. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Solution: Implement access control mechanisms to protect sensitive data. Make sure that the getPrice() method is only accessible to authorized users.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the getPrice() method is part of debug code that was left over in a production application, it could expose sensitive information or functionality that is not intended for end users.
Solution: Remove debug code or ensure it's properly isolated before deploying the application to production. Use logging mechanisms to capture debug information instead of leaving debug code in the application.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for the Return of Correct Price Value

Details:
  TestName: testReturnOfCorrectPriceValue.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value set for the object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and set a price value.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the price set for the object.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method correctly retrieves the set price value. The expected result is that the returned value matches the price set for the object. This test is significant in ensuring that the price retrieval functionality works as expected.

Scenario 2: Test for Default Price Value Return

Details:
  TestName: testDefaultPriceValueReturn.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the default price value when no price is explicitly set for the object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object without setting a price value.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the default price value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method correctly retrieves the default price value when no price is set. The expected result is that the returned value matches the default price. This test is significant in ensuring that the price retrieval functionality works correctly in case of no explicitly set price.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Price Value Return

Details:
  TestName: testNegativePriceValueReturn.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method can handle negative price values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and set a negative price value.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the negative price set for the object.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method correctly retrieves the negative price value. The expected result is that the returned value matches the negative price set for the object. This test is significant in ensuring that the price retrieval functionality can handle negative values.

Scenario 4: Test for Zero Price Value Return

Details:
  TestName: testZeroPriceValueReturn.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method can handle a zero price value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and set a zero price value.
    Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the zero price set for the object.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method correctly retrieves the zero price value. The expected result is that the returned value matches the zero price set for the object. This test is significant in ensuring that the price retrieval functionality can handle zero values.
