================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getPrice() method might expose sensitive information through query strings in GET requests if it's used in a web application context. This could lead to information disclosure to unauthorized users.
Solution: Avoid passing sensitive data in the URL. Use POST requests instead of GET for sending sensitive data. If the getPrice() method is not intended for use in a web context, ensure it's not accessible through such means.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getPrice() method may expose sensitive information if the 'price' variable holds such data. This exposure can lead to privacy violation.
Solution: Ensure that any sensitive information is properly protected and not exposed through public methods. If necessary, consider using getter and setter methods that include appropriate access controls.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If getPrice() method is part of the debug code and it's left over in the production environment, it could expose sensitive information or functionality.
Solution: Remove debug code or any functionality not needed in the production environment before deploying the application. Always follow a clean code principle.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns the correct price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected price.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is functioning as expected. The expected result is the correct price value. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method returns the correct value as it might be used in several places in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a default value when the price is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDefaultValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method returns a default value (like 0 or null) when the price is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price to null or 0.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected default value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method returns a default value when the price is not set. This is important to ensure that the method handles such scenarios gracefully and does not cause any exceptions or errors in the application.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns a negative price

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsNegativeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getPrice method can return a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price to a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected negative value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method can handle negative values. This is important to check as prices are generally positive, and negative prices might indicate some problem in the application.
