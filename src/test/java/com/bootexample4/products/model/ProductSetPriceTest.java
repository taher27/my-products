================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The 'setPrice' method does not perform any validation on the 'price' parameter. This could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the method is called with invalid or malicious input.
Solution: Add input validation to the 'setPrice' method to ensure 'price' is within expected range. For example: if(price > 0 && price < MAX_PRICE) { this.price = price; } else { throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid price"); }

Vulnerability: CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard
Issue: The 'setPrice' method directly sets the value of 'price' without any checks or controls. This could be exploited to set the price to an arbitrary value.
Solution: Implement proper access control for the 'setPrice' method. It should only be accessible by trusted classes or methods.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code contains import statements for 'jakarta.persistence.*' classes, but there are no annotations or usage of these classes in the provided code. If these are remnants from debugging or development, they could potentially expose sensitive information or functionality if not properly secured.
Solution: Remove unused import statements to reduce the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities. Always ensure that only necessary classes are imported.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Positive Price Value

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceWithPositiveValue
    Description: This test aims to check if the method correctly sets the price when a positive value is given as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a price value with a positive double.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the positive price value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set correctly.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPrice method correctly sets the price when a positive value is provided. This is important to ensure that the method behaves as expected in normal use cases.

  Scenario 2: Test for Zero Price Value

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceWithZeroValue
    Description: This test aims to check if the method correctly sets the price when zero is given as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a price value with zero.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the zero price value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set to zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPrice method correctly sets the price when zero is provided. This is important for scenarios where the price could be zero.

  Scenario 3: Test for Negative Price Value

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceWithNegativeValue
    Description: This test aims to check if the method correctly sets the price when a negative value is given as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a price value with a negative double.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the negative price value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set to the negative value.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPrice method correctly sets the price when a negative value is provided. This is important for scenarios where the price could be negative, though in a real-world scenario, it might be unlikely.

  Scenario 4: Test for Large Price Value

  Details:
    TestName: testPriceWithLargeValue
    Description: This test aims to check if the method correctly sets the price when a very large value is given as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a price value with a large double.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the large price value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set to the large value.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setPrice method correctly sets the price when a large value is provided. This is important to ensure that the method can handle large values without causing overflow errors.
