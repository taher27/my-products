```
Scenario 1: Set a valid positive price

Details:
  TestName: setValidPositivePrice
  Description: Tests if the setPrice method correctly sets a valid positive price value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a positive double value (e.g., 150.0).
  Assert: Use getPrice to retrieve the price and assert that it equals the value set.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the price has been updated correctly in the Product object. Setting a valid positive price is crucial for accurately representing the product's cost in the system.

Scenario 2: Set a zero price

Details:
  TestName: setZeroPrice
  Description: Tests if the setPrice method correctly handles setting the price to zero, which might be valid in certain scenarios like promotional products.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a value of 0.0.
  Assert: Use getPrice to verify that the returned price is 0.0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the price can be set to zero, which is important for scenarios where products might be offered for free as promotions or special cases.

Scenario 3: Set a negative price

Details:
  TestName: setNegativePrice
  Description: Checks if the setPrice method can handle negative values, which might be used to indicate refunds or errors in pricing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a negative value (e.g., -50.0).
  Assert: Use getPrice to ensure that the price is set to the negative value.
Validation:
  This test verifies that negative prices are handled, which might be necessary for scenarios like refunds or adjustments in the system. This test checks the robustness of the price setting functionality.

Scenario 4: Set a very large price

Details:
  TestName: setVeryLargePrice
  Description: Ensures that the setPrice method can handle very large values without errors, which might occur in high-value transactions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a very large value (e.g., 1e6).
  Assert: Use getPrice to verify that the price equals the large value set.
Validation:
  This test checks the system's ability to handle large monetary values, ensuring that high-value products are accurately represented in the system.

Scenario 5: Set a very small positive price

Details:
  TestName: setVerySmallPositivePrice
  Description: Tests if the setPrice method can handle very small positive values, representing low-cost items.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class.
  Act: Call the setPrice method with a very small positive value (e.g., 0.01).
  Assert: Use getPrice to verify that the price equals the small value set.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the system can accurately handle small monetary values, which is important for pricing low-cost items or services in the system.
```

These scenarios ensure comprehensive testing of the `setPrice` method across various typical and edge cases, validating the method's functionality and robustness in handling different price settings.
