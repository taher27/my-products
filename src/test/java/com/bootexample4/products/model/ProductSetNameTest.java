  Scenario 1: Test setName with valid string value

  Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithValidString
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method setName is able to set a valid string as the name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and a valid string name.
    Act: Invoke the setName method on the instance with the string as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the instance's name is equal to the string provided.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the setName method is functioning correctly and able to set a valid string as name. The expected result is the string we provided because that's what we set as the name. This is significant as it ensures the setName method is working correctly.

  Scenario 2: Test setName with null value

  Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithNull
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method can handle a null value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the class.
    Act: Invoke the setName method on the instance with null as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the instance's name is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the setName method is functioning correctly when given null as a parameter. The expected result is null because that's what we set as the name. This is significant as it tests the robustness of the setName method.

  Scenario 3: Test setName with empty string

  Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithEmptyString
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method can handle an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the class.
    Act: Invoke the setName method on the instance with an empty string as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the instance's name is an empty string.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the setName method is functioning correctly when given an empty string as a parameter. The expected result is an empty string because that's what we set as the name. This is significant as it tests the ability of the setName method to handle edge cases.
