================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The setName method can potentially be exploited to expose sensitive information if it's used in HTTP GET requests, as these requests carry parameters in URL strings.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive data in GET requests. Instead, use HTTP POST requests or other methods that do not expose data in URL strings.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The setName method directly sets the value of the 'name' variable, potentially exposing it to unauthorized access if proper access control is not in place.
Solution: Implement proper access control mechanisms. Make sure that the 'name' variable is private and can only be accessed through getter and setter methods.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the setName method is part of debug code left in the production environment, it can expose sensitive information or system internals.
Solution: Ensure all debug code is removed or disabled in the production environment.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Name Input Test

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithValidInput
  Description: This test is meant to check the setName() method when a valid name is provided as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a String variable with a valid name.
  Act: Invoke the setName() method with the valid name as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual name set by the method against the expected name.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setName() method correctly sets the name when provided with a valid input. The test is significant in ensuring the correct functionality of the setName() method.

Scenario 2: Null Name Input Test

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithNullInput
  Description: This test is meant to check the setName() method when a null value is provided as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a String variable with a null value.
  Act: Invoke the setName() method with the null value as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual name set by the method against the expected null value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setName() method correctly handles a null input and sets the name to null. The test is crucial in ensuring the robustness of the setName() method.

Scenario 3: Empty String Name Input Test

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithEmptyString
  Description: This test is meant to check the setName() method when an empty string is provided as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a String variable with an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the setName() method with the empty string as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual name set by the method against the expected empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setName() method correctly handles an empty string input and sets the name to an empty string. This test is important to ensure that the setName() method can handle edge cases.

Scenario 4: Long String Name Input Test

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithLongString
  Description: This test is meant to check the setName() method when a long string is provided as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a String variable with a long string.
  Act: Invoke the setName() method with the long string as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual name set by the method against the expected long string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the setName() method correctly handles a long string input and sets the name accordingly. This test is crucial to ensure that the setName() method can handle a wide range of input sizes.
