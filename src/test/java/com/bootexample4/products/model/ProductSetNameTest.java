================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The method setName makes changes to name, potentially exposing sensitive information. If an attacker can access this method, they can control name's content.
Solution: Add verification and validation processes to setName method. Consider using Java's built-in security features to control access to setName method.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The method setName does not validate its input. This may cause unexpected behavior or allow an attacker to inject malicious input.
Solution: Always validate input to prevent unexpected behavior and InputInjection. For string values, ensure that they do not contain script-injecting special characters.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Testing the method with a normal string
Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithNormalString
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method properly sets the name when provided with a normal string.
Execution:
    Arrange: A normal string, for example, "sampleName".
    Act: Invoke setName with the created string.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to compare getName() to "sampleName".
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that setName has correctly set the provided string as the name. This is fundamental for the basic functionality of setName.

Scenario 2: Testing the method with an empty string
Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithEmptyString
    Description: This test is meant to check how setName method behaves when provided with an empty string.
Execution:
    Arrange: An empty string "".
    Act: Invoke setName with the empty string.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to compare getName() with an empty string.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that setName can handle an empty string and still properly sets the name. This is significant for handling edge cases where the user might want to set the name as an empty string.

Scenario 3: Testing the method with a null input
Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithNullInput
    Description: This test is meant to check how setName behaves when given a null input.
Execution:
    Arrange: A null string.
    Act: Invoke setName with the null string.
    Assert: Use assertNull to check if getName() also returns null.
Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that setName can handle a null name without causing any unexpected behavior. This is significant for handling edge cases and validating input robustness.

Scenario 4: Testing the method with a very long string
Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithLongString
    Description: This test is meant to check the setName method's behavior when provided with a very long string.
Execution:
    Arrange: A very long string with 500 characters.
    Act: Invoke setName with the created long string.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to compare getName() to the long string.
Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that setName can handle a long string properly. This is significant for managing user input of various lengths and ensuring robustness in edge cases.

Scenario 5: Testing the method with special characters in the string
Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithSpecialCharacters
    Description: This test is meant to check how setName method behaves when provided with a string that has special characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: A string with special characters, for example, "n@m€_String".
    Act: Invoke setName with the created string.
    Assert: Use assertEquals to compare getName() to "n@m€_String".
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that setName can properly set a name with special characters. This is significant in ensuring the method can handle various types of user inputs.
